# pyrosim
A Python Robot Simulator.

For Mac and Linux users (currently not available for Windows):

Step 1: Run build.sh:
```bash
$ sh build.sh
```

This takes three to five minutes. The output should look like this:
```
Unpacking ode-0.12.tar.bz2...done
Building ode-0.12...done
Building simulator...done
```

Step 2: Test the package by running
```bash
$ python Demo_00_Empty_Sim.py 
```
This should bring up an OpenGL window displaying an empty, virtual world.
The window will close on its own after a few seconds.

Step 3: To build robots and environments for them, follow the programming

starting with step #3.
